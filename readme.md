by Osama Mohamed Naguib


## Dataset

   > * Dataset has over 110'000 observations for patients schdeduled medical appointments data; including the following features:
        * 'Gender', 'ScheduledDay', 'AppointmentDay', 'Age', 'Neighbourhood', 'Scholarship', 'Hipertension','Diabetes', 'Alcoholism', 'Handcap', 'SMS_received', 'No-show'
    > * We will investigate the correlation between most of these independent variables with the depedent variable "the missed appointments" ~NO-Show incidences).
    > Major insights about the Study Sample:
        * % of Patient who had a SCHOLARSHIP is  9.83 %.

        * % of Patinets who had HYPERTENSION is  19.72 % 

        * % of Patinets who had DIABETES is  7.19 % 

        * % of Patinets who are ALCOHOLIC is  3.04 % 

        * % of HANDICAPPED Patients Percent is  2.03 % 

        * % of Patients who received SMS is  32.1 % 

        * % of Patients who missed their medical appointments is  20.19 %

        * % of most of the appointments carried on on May and june, and few in April with a     percentage of `73%, 23%, and 3%`, respectively.


        * % of Adults Patients from 30 to 50 had the higher proportion of the sample with `~ 26%`,      followed by Children and Older Adults with  `~ 25%` and `~ 20%`,respectively, then comes     the young Adults (from 18 till 29), and Geriatrics (above 65) with `~ 15%` and `~ 13%`,      respectively.

        * Most of Scheduling dates were assigned after the appointmet dates `(~ 35%)` with negative     values/days ranging from -7 days till -1 day , while about `30%` of appointment had been     scheduled prior with a leading days of 10 or more, meanwhile leading days of 1 to 10 days         accounted for about `30%` of appointments, and finally about only `5%` of scheduled dates       were assignend at the same day of the appointment



## Summary of Findings

>  Hypertension, Diabetic, Handicapped, older Adults and Geriatric Patients had lesser missed appointments.
> Receiving sms by Patients who had 5 or more leading days (days between scheduled and appointments dates) had fewer missed appointments rates.
> loger leading times above 10 days were associated with higher missed appointment incidences than average.
> older Ages (from 50 and above) tend to stick to their scheduled medical appointments.
> Comorbidities with hypertension, diabeted or handicapped patients had fewer missed appointments rates than normal patients.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Focosing on the patients who had higher missed appointments rates such as younger ages, Patients wihout comorbidities with chronic diases such as hypertension and diabetes, by ensuring shorter leading days, and sms reminders at least 5 days and earlier to the appointment day, shall improve their commitments and increase the planning accuracy and so, resources ultilization shall improve as well.
